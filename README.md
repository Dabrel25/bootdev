# My Boot.dev Learning Journey

This repository contains my projects and exercises completed during my programming education on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). 
Boot.dev is a back-end developer bootcamp that provides a structured learning experience for aspiring developers. 


## Projects

### Heifer

A foundational project exploring JavaScript modules and package management. This project covers:
